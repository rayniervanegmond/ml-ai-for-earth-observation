<span style="font-size:20pt">An Introduction and Outline</span>

The developments of deep learning methods is one of the fastest developing areas in computer science to-date. Its influence on society is rapidly expanding and --some would say-- not always for the good of society. Most of the developments that the press and society call artificial intelligence are based on the application of deep learning methods and techniques. Deep learning is grounded in the application of what are called artificial neural networks. A method of computing where the data structures are used to detect and learn patterns in datasets using one of a few types of processing. 

Generally the field of machine learning (of which deep learning is a sub-field) are divided into the following main categories:

* **unsupervised learning**: the algorithm learns to cluster observations together based on shared properties and most similar values thereof. The algorithm learns to detect these clusters or groups from the observations only and is not provided with labels for the observations.
* **supervised learning**: in this case the algorithm learns from the datasets by means of observations and labels. The labels provide the relationship between input observations and labels. The learned relations are classifications if the labels represent distinct categories of objects or regressions of the "label" is a real-value.
* **semi-supervised learning**: in this case the algorithm learns the relations from a limited set of labeled observations and a large number of unlabeled observations. The techniques transfer the information gleaned from the labeled observations onto the unlabeled observations  after which it can use these observations to improve the learned classification or regression problem.
* **generative learning**: in this case the algorithm learns to create outputs that are similar in nature to the provided input observations.
* **reinforcement learning**: this is a very different kind of learning algorithm and its primary objective is learn strategies on how to solve a problem. It finds an optimal approach to find a solution by executing an immense amount of trial-and-error attempts and record which approaches worked best to solve the problem. Ultimately the algorithm learns the optimal way to execute a task.

The field of deep-learning applies to each of these categories. The deep learning methods are simply other ways of doing the activity. What sets the deep learning approach apart from the traditional machine learning methods is that the latter use "pre-defined features" its decision processes are based on the a-priori definition of features that guide the solution. In the deep learning situation the main applications provide unstructured information from which the algorithm learns and applies the features that best solve the problem (classification or regression). It is in this field of feature learning in fields like computer vision, natural language processing or dataset interpretations that the new deep learning methods shine and deliver state-of-the-art solutions. 

In this chapter we will begin the discussion of deep learning with an introduction into the underlying data constructs called Artificial Neural Networks (abbrev. ANN). We will discuss their structure and how various architectures of such ANN exhibit best performances for specific problems. We will explore the interesting field of deep learning through a series of Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate the concepts and how we can use deep learning using the Pytorch ecosystem of tools, libraries and datasets.

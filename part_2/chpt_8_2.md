# <span style="color:cornflowerblue;">Chapter 8.2 - An annotated sample project for image classification </span>

In this chapter we will look at a sample image classification project that is mainly used to illustrate the scaffolding template with an actual working project that you could use for your own use. The project use a state-of-the-art pretrained neural network that can recognize images with any one of a 1000 classes.

## Chapter Notebooks

simple image classification project  [<i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-circle-right" style="margin-left:10px;color:teal;"></i>](notebooks/chpt_8/001-image-classification)
: The purpose of this notebook is to provide a simple illustrative example of a full image classification project. Its main purpose is to show how the project scaffolding template is used and what the main steps in a project look like. It is more heavily annotated than regular project notebooks would be.

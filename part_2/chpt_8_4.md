landscape cover or landscape use semantic segmentation project  [<i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-circle-right" style="margin-left:10px;color:teal;"></i>](notebooks/chpt_8/003-lclu-type-classification)
: The purpose of this notebook is to show how we can use semantic segmentation to create pixel level classifications in satellite images. The application of semantic segmentation is a very important type of processing that often used for monitoring of land cover where the number of pixels in each class is compared between images of the same area of interest across time. The technique can also be used to see how the land cover changes in nature; say from forest to urbanized areas.

    "In this chapter we will look at a sample image classification project that is mainly used to illustrate the scaffolding template with an actual working project that you could use for your own use. The project use a state-of-the-art pretrained neural network that can recognize images with any one of a 1000 classes. \n",

Its main purpose is to show how the project scaffolding template is used and what the main steps in a project look like. It is more heavily annotated than regular project notebooks would be."

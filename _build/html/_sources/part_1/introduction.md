In this first chapter of the book we will discuss the nature of the Earth Observation and Monitoring field and how it poses sme interesting and challenging problems to the application of machine learning and deep learning. For those who come to the field with the intent to apply their ML/DL skills to some of the worlds most pressing problems; think of ecosystem preservation, biodiversity issues, health care and urban development, sustainability and climate change, but lack the knowledge of these fields this first part of the eBook is the entry point to the field.

In this Part 1 "introduction to the field of Earth Observation and Monitoring" we will look at the benefits satellite-based observation of earth ecological and biophysical processes provides over in-situ based observations. We will see that space based observations enable us to have a much broader view of what's happening on the surface of the globe and the application of machine learning and deep learning allows us to fill in the blanks for those regions where we cannot do observations or have limited resources in observers.

The part aims to provide a solid grounding in the types of observations that we can obtain from the various satellite platforms. Not all satellites are doing the same thing. Each satellite is launched into space with a specific mission objective and it has sensors onboard that make measurements very specific to the mission at hand. Sometimes these sensors are placed in space because precursors have reached end-of-life and it is imperative to create long-duration time series of similar observations/measurements. Other times a mission is equipped with sensors for very specific sensors that are only expected to be operational for a short period. These are sometimes experimental sensors that are expected to be deployed in longer duration missions in the future and sometimes the sensors are for very specific short-term objectives.

In **chapter 1** we address the benefits of space satellite-based observations and the various type of satellite sensors that are being deployed. We will discuss the foundation for all space based observations, the electro-magnetic spectrum, the difference between active and passive sensors and the emission-based sensors versus the absorption-based sensors. The former are based on the reflection of specific bands in the EM-spectrum while the latter are mostly applied in the context of atmospheric composition monitoring like we see for green house gas emission monitoring and air quality monitoring.

In **chapter 2** we will shift focus from the underlying technology to the types of observation and monitoring activities we do with satellite-based observations. There are a number of prominent fields that we use satellite based earth observation and monitoring applications for. As we discussed in chapter 1 may of these applications are related to environmental and climate change monitoring but we use the satellite-based sensors platforms also for tings like disaster risk assessment and management, public health monitoring and many more. 

For these applications we use specific types
